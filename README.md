# cypress-data-cy-highlight

A chrome extension that highlights elements with the `data-cy` attribute. The element can be exported to a file for further review.


## Store Page: TBD


## Loading the unpacked plugin (not from the store)

The unpacked plugin is located in the src folder

[chrome developer docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)

Follow the instructions located at the above url. It's probably a good idea to read through that entire tutorial.

## Bundling the extension

Run:

```
npm run bundle
```

This will create a zip file named `extension.zip` in the root directory of the project. This zip file can be uploaded to the chrome web store for distribution.
